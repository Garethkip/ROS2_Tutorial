# ROS2_Tutorial
A simple teaching to understand the tools needed to begin projects with the Robot Operating System

## Introduction
**ROS2** stands for the Robot Operating System which is defined as an open source development kit and middleware used for robotic development. It consists of four main elements:
1. Framework - Is a re-usable software foundation with pre-written code, libraries and tools that provide a structured template to simplify and accelerate development of software applications. ROS is therefore made up of packages that contain nodes(contains your programmes e.g. motor driver code) which communicate with each other.
2. Set of tools - you can find command-line tools to build the application, introspection tools to monitor the flow of communication, logging functionalities, plots, and more.
3. Plug-and-Play plugins - such as the nav2 or moveit2 stacks that prevent you from re-inventing the wheel or starting from scratch e.g. in the design of a mobile navigating or object sorting robot.
4. Online Community - Platforms such as the Robotics Discorce Forum and the Robotics Stack Exchange allow for collaboration and knowledge sharing among users.
